# Programming as a Way of Thinking

Chapter 1 introduces Python not just as a tool, but as a formal language. Mastering these sub-topics is essential before moving toward complex data analysis.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Python acts as a powerful calculator. The primary operators include:
- **Addition (`+`) & Subtraction (`-`):** Basic arithmetic.
- **Multiplication (`*`):** Standard product.
- **Division (`/`):** Always results in a **floating-point** number (e.g., `84 / 2 = 42.0`).
- **Floor Division (`//`):** Rounds down to the nearest integer (e.g., `85 // 2 = 42`).
- **Exponentiation (`**`):** Raises a number to a power.
- **XOR (`^`):** A bitwise operator. Note: `7 ^ 2` is `5`, not `49`.



## 2. Expressions and Order of Operations
An **expression** is a combination of values and operators. Python follows mathematical precedence (PEMDAS):
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication/Division `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. Addition/Subtraction `+`, `-`

## 3. Arithmetic Functions
Beyond operators, Python uses **function calls** to process numbers:
- **`round(value)`:** Rounds to the nearest whole number.
- **`abs(value)`:** Computes the absolute value.
- **Syntax Rule:** Functions *must* have parentheses. `abs -42` will trigger a `SyntaxError`.

## 4. Strings
Strings (`str`) are sequences of characters.
- **Quotes:** Can use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. Double quotes are useful for strings containing apostrophes: `"it's a small world"`.
- **Concatenation (`+`):** Joins strings together.
- **Repetition (`*`):** Repeats a string multiple times (e.g., `'Spam' * 4`).
- **Function `len()`:** Returns the count of characters in a string.



## 5. Values and Types
Every value belongs to a **type**:
- `2` is an **int** (integer).
- `42.0` is a **float** (floating-point).
- `'Hello'` is a **str** (string).
- **Type Conversion:** We can use `int()`, `float()`, and `str()` to convert values.
- **The "Comma" Trap:** Python treats `1,000,000` as a **tuple** (1, 0, 0), not a million. Use underscores for readability: `1_000_000`.

## 6. Formal vs. Natural Languages
This is the most important conceptual shift for a programmer:
- **Natural Languages:** Evolved naturally (English, Nepali). High ambiguity and redundancy.
- **Formal Languages:** Designed for specific goals (Math, Python). Zero ambiguity, highly concise, and strictly literal.

## 7. Debugging: The Managerial Mindset
Errors are called **bugs**. Debugging is the process of fixing them.
- **The Computer's Nature:** It is fast and precise but lacks empathy and "big picture" understanding.
- **Your Role:** Think like a manager. Be patient, use logic to find where the instructions were literal but incorrect, and don't let emotions interfere with the process.

## 8. Exercise: Calculation Practice
To apply these concepts, I calculated the average pace for a 10km run completed in 42 minutes and 42 seconds.

```python
# Calculating pace in minutes and seconds per mile
distance_km = 10
distance_miles = distance_km / 1.61
total_seconds = (42 * 60) + 42
pace_sec_per_mile = total_seconds / distance_miles

print("Minutes:", pace_sec_per_mile // 60)
print("Seconds:", pace_sec_per_mile % 60)
```
**Result:** ~6 minutes and 52 seconds per mile.
