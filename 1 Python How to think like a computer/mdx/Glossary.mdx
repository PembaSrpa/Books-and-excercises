# Master Python Glossary

This document serves as the definitive reference for the Python programming language. It provides a comprehensive overview of the language's core concepts, including programming as a way of thinking, variables and statements, functions, classes, and more.

---

## 1. Programming as a Way of Thinking

* **Arithmetic operator:** A symbol, like + and *, that denotes an arithmetic operation like addition or multiplication.
* **Integer:** A type that represents whole numbers.
* **Floating-point:** A type that represents numbers with fractional parts.
* **Integer division:** An operator, //, that divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer.
* **Expression:** A combination of variables, values, and operators.
* **Value:** An integer, floating-point number, or string—or one of other kinds of values we will see later.
* **Function:** A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.
* **Function call:** An expression—or part of an expression—that runs a function. It consists of the function name followed by an argument list in parentheses.
* **Syntax error:** An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse—and therefore impossible to run.
* **String:** A type that represents sequences of characters.
* **Concatenation:** Joining two strings end to end.
* **Type:** A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).
* **Operand:** One of the values on which an operator operates.
* **Natural language:** Any of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.
* **Formal language:** Any of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs. All programming languages are formal languages.
* **Bug:** An error in a program.
* **Debugging:** The process of finding and correcting errors.

## 2. Variables and Statements

* **Variable:** A name that refers to a value.
* **Assignment statement:** A statement that assigns a value to a variable.
* **State diagram:** A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values they refer to.

* **Keyword:** A special word used to specify the structure of a program.
* **Import statement:** A statement that reads a module file and creates a module object.
* **Module:** A file that contains Python code, including function definitions and sometimes other statements.
* **Dot operator:** The operator, ., used to access a function in another module by specifying the module name followed by a dot and the function name.
* **Statement:** One or more lines of code that represent a command or action.
* **Evaluate:** Perform the operations in an expression in order to compute a value.
* **Execute:** Run a statement and do what it says.
* **Argument:** A value provided to a function when the function is called. Each argument is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function.
* **Comment:** Text included in a program that provides information about the program but has no effect on its execution.
* **Runtime error:** An error that causes a program to display an error message and exit.
* **Exception:** An error that is detected while the program is running.
* **Semantic error:** An error that causes a program to do the wrong thing, but not to display an error message.

## 3. Functions

* **Function definition:** A statement that creates a function.
* **Header:** The first line of a function definition.
* **Body:** The sequence of statements inside a function definition.
* **Function object:** A value created by a function definition. The name of the function is a variable that refers to a function object.
* **Parameter:** A name used inside a function to refer to the value passed as an argument.
* **Loop:** A statement that runs one or more statements, often repeatedly.
* **Local variable:** A variable defined inside a function, which can only be accessed inside the function.
* **Stack diagram:** A graphical representation of a stack of functions, their variables, and the values they refer to.

* **Generalization:** The process of replacing something unnecessarily specific (like a number) with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
* **Keyword argument:** An argument that includes the name of the parameter.
* **Refactoring:** The process of modifying a working program to improve function interfaces and other qualities of the code.
* **Development plan:** A process for writing programs.
* **Docstring:** A string that appears at the top of a function definition to document the function’s interface.
* **Multiline string:** A string enclosed in triple quotes that can span more than one line of a program.
* **Precondition:** A requirement that should be satisfied by the caller before a function starts.
* **Postcondition:** A requirement that should be satisfied by the function before it ends.

## 5. Conditionals and Recursion

* **Recursion:** The process of calling the function that is currently executing.
* **Modulus operator:** An operator, %, that works on integers and returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.
* **Boolean expression:** An expression whose value is either True or False.
* **Relational operator:** One of the operators that compares its operands: ==, !=, >, &lt;, &gt;=, and &lt;=.
* **Logical operator:** One of the operators that combines boolean expressions, including and, or, and not.
* **Conditional statement:** A statement that controls the flow of execution, depending on some condition.
* **Block:** One or more statements indented to indicate they are part of another statement.
* **Condition:** The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which branch runs.
* **Branch:** One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement.
* **Chained conditional:** A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches.
* **Nested conditional:** A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another conditional statement.
* **Recursive:** A function that calls itself.
* **Base case:** A conditional branch in a recursive function that does not make a recursive call.
* **Infinite recursion:** A recursion that doesn’t have a base case, or never reaches it. Eventually, an infinite recursion causes a runtime error.
* **Newline:** A character that creates a line break between two parts of a string.

## 6. Return Values

* **Return value:** The result of a function. If a function call is used as an expression, the return value is the value of the expression.
* **Pure function:** A function that does not display anything or have any other effect, other than returning a return value.
* **Dead code:** Part of a program that can never run, often because it appears after a return statement.
* **Incremental development:** A program development plan intended to avoid debugging by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.
* **Scaffolding:** Code that is used during program development but is not part of the final version.
* **Turing complete:** A language, or subset of a language, is Turing complete if it can perform any computation that can be described by an algorithm.
* **Input validation:** Checking the parameters of a function to make sure they have the correct types and values.

## 7. Iteration and Search

* **Loop variable:** A variable defined in the header of a for loop.
* **File object:** An object that represents an open file and keeps track of which parts of the file have been read or written.
* **Method:** A function associated with an object and called using the dot operator.
* **Update:** An assignment statement that gives a new value to a variable that already exists, rather than creating a new variable.
* **Initialize:** Create a new variable and give it a value.
