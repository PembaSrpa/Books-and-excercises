# Functions

In Chapter 3, we move from writing flat scripts to creating reusable blocks of code. For a Data Analyst, functions are the building blocks of automated reporting and repeatable data cleaning pipelines.

## 1. Function Definitions and Objects
A **function definition** creates a new function. In Python, the name of the function is actually a variable that refers to a **function object**.

* **Header:** The first line, starting with `def` and ending with a colon.
* **Body:** The indented sequence of statements that perform the operation.



## 2. Parameters and Arguments
Understanding the distinction between these two is vital for "Best-in-Class" documentation:
* **Argument:** The actual value you pass into the function when you call it (e.g., `42`).
* **Parameter:** The name used inside the function to refer to that value (e.g., `n`).

## 3. Local Variables and Scope
Variables defined inside a function are **local**. They exist only within that function's "frame" and cannot be accessed from the global scope. This prevents naming conflicts in large projects.

## 4. Stack Diagrams and Frames
To track which variables belong to which function, we use **Stack Diagrams**.
* **Frame:** A box representing a function call, containing the local variables and parameters.
* **Stack:** The collection of frames currently active. If a function calls another function, a new frame is added to the top of the stack.



## 5. Tracebacks
When a **Runtime Error** occurs, Python prints a **Traceback**. This is a list of the functions that were executing at the time of the crash. Reading it from the bottom up allows you to see exactly which line failed and the sequence of calls that led there.

## 6. Flow of Execution
Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Function definitions do not execute the code inside them; they only create the function object. The code inside the body only runs when the function is **called**.
