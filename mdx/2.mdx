# Variables, Expressions, and Statements

Chapter 2 moves from simple calculations to **state management**—how we store, name, and manipulate data using variables.

## 1. Assignment Statements
An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value.
- **Syntax:** `message = 'And now for something completely different'`
- **State:** In memory, the variable name points to the value.
- **Variable Types:** The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.



## 2. Variable Names
To keep code "Best-in-Class," naming conventions are vital:
- **Rules:** Can contain letters and numbers, but must start with a letter. Underscores (`_`) are standard for multi-word names (snake_case).
- **Keywords:** You cannot use Python's reserved words (like `if`, `True`, `while`, `import`) as variable names.
- **Clean Code Tip:** Use intention-revealing names. Instead of `n = 100`, use `total_users = 100`.

## 3. Expressions and Statements
- **Expression:** A combination of values, variables, and operators that the interpreter evaluates to find a value.
- **Statement:** A unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.
- **Key Difference:** An expression has a value; a statement does not.

## 4. Script Mode vs. Interactive Mode
- **Interactive Mode:** Great for quick tests. It automatically displays the result of expressions.
- **Script Mode:** Used for building real applications. Expressions without `print()` will run but won't display anything to the user.

## 5. Order of Operations
Python follows mathematical precedence (PEMDAS).
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents `**`
3. Multiplication/Division `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. Addition/Subtraction `+`, `-`

## 6. String Operations
While math operators generally don't work on strings, there are two exceptions:
- **Concatenation (`+`):** Joins strings (`'first' + 'second'`).
- **Repetition (`*`):** Multiplies strings (`'Spam' * 3`).

## 7. Comments
Comments start with `#`.
- **Purpose:** To explain the *why*, not the *what*.
- **Rule:** As a "Best-in-Class" Analyst, use them to document assumptions in your data formulas.

## 8. Debugging: Syntax, Runtime, and Semantic Errors
- **Syntax Error:** Putting a period `.` at the end of a statement.
- **ModuleNotFoundError:** Misspelling a module (e.g., `import maath`). This is a runtime error.
- **Semantic Error:** The code runs, but the math is wrong (logic error).



## 9. Exercise: The Math Module & Sphere Volume
Working with the `math` module for geometric and trigonometric calculations.

### Part 1: Volume of a Sphere
**Formula:** $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$

```python
import math

# radius is in centimeters
radius = 5
# volume is in cubic centimeters
volume = (4/3) * math.pi * radius**3

print("Sphere Volume:", volume)
```

### Part 2: Trigonometric Identity
Testing if $\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1$ for $x = 42$.

```python
x = 42
result = math.cos(x)**2 + math.sin(x)**2
print("Trig Identity Result:", result)
# Output is 1.0 (Approximate due to floating-point precision)
```

### Part 3: Three Ways to Compute $e^2$
The `math` module provides specialized tools for Euler's number ($e$).

1. **Exponent Operator:** `math.e ** 2`
2. **The Pow Function:** `math.pow(math.e, 2)`
3. **The Exp Function:** `math.exp(2)`

**Observation:** `math.exp(2)` is the most accurate as it is optimized for exponential growth calculations without intermediate rounding steps.

### Reflection
Mastering variables and the `math` module is the bridge between basic scripting and Data Analysis. Understanding how Python handles floating-point precision prevents errors in financial or scientific datasets later in the roadmap.
