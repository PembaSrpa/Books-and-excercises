# Conditionals and Recursion

Chapter 5 bridges the gap between linear code and dynamic logic. For a Data Analyst, understanding conditionals is essential for data filtering, while recursion provides the basis for navigating complex data structures.

## 1. Boolean Expressions and Logical Operators
A **boolean expression** evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- **Relational Operators:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, and `not`. These allow for complex data validation (e.g., checking if a value is within a specific range).

## 2. Conditional Execution
Conditional statements control the flow of execution:
- **if/else:** Basic binary decision making.
- **Chained Conditionals (`elif`):** Used when there are more than two possibilities.
- **Nested Conditionals:** An `if` statement inside another. *Clean Code Tip:* Favor chained conditionals over deeply nested ones to improve readability.



## 3. Recursion
**Recursion** is the process of a function calling itself.
- **The Base Case:** Every recursive function must have a branch that does *not* make a recursive call. Without this, the program will trigger an **Infinite Recursion**.
- **Stack Depth:** Python has a limit on recursion (usually around 3,000 frames). Exceeding this causes a `RecursionError`.



## 4. Keyboard Input
The `input()` function allows programs to be interactive.
- **Default Type:** `input()` always returns a **string**.
- **Type Casting:** If numerical data is needed, you must wrap it in `int()` or `float()`.
- **The Newline (`\n`):** A special character used to move the cursor to the next line for a cleaner UI.

## 5. Debugging: Reading Error Messages
Error messages indicate where a problem was *discovered*, not necessarily where it *occurred*.
- **IndentationError:** Often caused by mixing tabs and spaces or "invisible" extra spaces.
- **ValueError:** Occurs when type conversion fails (e.g., `int("hello")`).
- **Math Domain Error:** Occurs when an argument is outside a function's mathematical range (e.g., `math.log10(0)`).



## 6. Advanced Exercises: Recursion in Action

### Exercise: The Unix Epoch
Calculating time using floor division (`//`) and the modulus operator (`%`).
```python
from time import time
total_seconds = time()
days = total_seconds // (24 * 3600)
# Remaining seconds are used to find current hours/minutes/seconds
```

### Exercise: Recursive Graphics (Koch Curve)
I used recursion to draw the Koch curve, a fractal shape where each segment is replaced by four smaller segments.
```python
def koch(t, x):
    if x < 5:
        t.fd(x)
    else:
        koch(t, x/3)
        t.lt(60)
        koch(t, x/3)
        t.rt(120)
        koch(t, x/3)
        t.lt(60)
        koch(t, x/3)
```



### Exercise: The Sierpiński Triangle
A more advanced recursive pattern where a triangle is divided into smaller sub-triangles. This exercise demonstrates how recursion can create complex, self-similar structures with very little code.

### Reflection
Step 5 teaches us that programming is about handling **exceptions** and **branches**. In Data Analytics, this logic is applied every time we use an `IF` statement in Excel or a `WHERE` clause in SQL. Mastering the recursive mindset also prepares me for understanding tree-based machine learning models later in the roadmap.
